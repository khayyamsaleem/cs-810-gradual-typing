* Gradual Typing
** Concept
   - Type system developed by Jeremy Siek and Walid Taha in 2006
   - Allows some parts of a program to be dynamically typed and other parts to be statically typed
     - Determined by presence of type annotation added by programmer
** Static Typing
   - Process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program's source code
   - If a program passes a static type checker, then the program is guaranteed to satisfy some set of type safety properties for all possible inputs
   - Type checking completed during compilation process
     


*** Pros                           :BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:
    - Pros
     - catches bugs early
     - faster execution
     - improves modularity


*** Cons                           :BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:
    - Cons
     - makes code more verbose
     - prevents program execution
     
** Dynamic Typing
   - Process of type-checking at run-time
   - Associates each runtime object with a /type tag/

     
*** Pros                           :BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:
    - Pros
     - offers flexibility
     - doesn't get "in the way" of execution
     - allows for typing based on runtime information

*** Cons                           :BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.5
    :END:
    - Cons
     - cannot conclusively declare safety
     - errors may lie deep in subroutine calls
     - slower execution

** Utility of Gradual Typing
   - Gradual typing allows for type checks at compile-time for type errors in some parts of a program, directed by type annotations.
   - Since it is tough to declare that static typing is universally better or worse than dynamic typing, gradual typing offers the programmer a choice, without requiring a change in language
